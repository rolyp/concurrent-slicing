# concurrent-slicing

Agda development accompanying the paper _Causally consistent dynamic
slicing_.

## Required libraries:

* Agda version 2.4.2.3
* Agda standard library version 0.9
* `agda-stdlib-ext`, version [0.0.2] (https://github.com/rolyp/agda-stdlib-ext/releases/tag/0.0.2)
* `proof-relevant-pi`, version [0.2] (https://github.com/rolyp/proof-relevant-pi/releases/tag/0.2)

## Tasks

* Functor-like postulates in `Proc.Ren.Lattice`
* `to-↓-preserves-+` postulate
* `getᴹ` postulate in `Ren.Lattice`
* Commutative pentagon for concurrent transition-slices
* Lattice iso for generalised bound braid
* Galois connection for renamings of transition sequences
* Commutative square for cofinality witness
* Lattice iso relating targets of causally equivalent traces
* `≃-sym` postulate in `proof-relevant-pi`

### Minor

* Better names in Galois connection for transition sequences
* Easy postulates in `Transition.Lattice`
* `target⋆ᴹ` for transition sequences
* Example
* Low-hanging fruit aligning Agda names with paper
* Bump revision numbers for `agda-stdlib-ext`, `proof-relevant-pi` and `concurrent-slicing`
