# concurrent-slicing

In-progress Agda development accompanying the paper _Causally consistent
dynamic slicing_.

## Required libraries:

* Agda version 2.4.2.3
* Agda standard library version 0.9
* `agda-stdlib-ext`, version [0.0.2] (https://github.com/rolyp/agda-stdlib-ext/releases/tag/0.0.2)
* `proof-relevant-pi`, version [0.2] (https://github.com/rolyp/proof-relevant-pi/releases/tag/0.2)

## Tasks

* _Example_
* Prove functor-like postulates in `Proc.Ren.Lattice`
* Prove easy postulates in `Transition.Lattice`
* Galois connection for generalised bound braid
* `target⋆ᴹ` for transition sequences
* _Galois connection for transition sequences_
* Galois connection for renamings of transition sequences
* Lattice isomorphism for transition slice and (generalised) bound braid
* Lattice isomorphism for transition sequence slice and (generalised) bound braid
* Galois connection relating targets of causally equivalent transition
  sequences (composite braiding?)
